Issues found when testing GNS32.0, the latest release.

Release Notes: https://docs.gns3.com/1jtdTQAcKa7JmQTNH2LoxQmOYalts7O0urmZ9CNnoEpU/index.html

Using the GNS32.0 remote server and the GSN32.0 gui.

1.) When using an already existing remote server setup in the gns.conf images need to be updated.
    
    This can be fixed by removing and re-adding the images back to the gns3-gui.
    
2.) Ethernet Switches when using local can not connect to remote server connections.

3.) Dual local server and remote server causes issues with remote server reporting could not find dynamips on remote server for ethernet switches and transferring of images does not work.

Solution: create new profile for 'remote-only', allows for re-creation of images by re-importing. Seemed to have cleaned up the issue.

4.) Docker issue with the client running API 1.25 and the server running API 1.24.
