Issues found when testing GNS32.0, the latest release.

Release Notes: https://docs.gns3.com/1jtdTQAcKa7JmQTNH2LoxQmOYalts7O0urmZ9CNnoEpU/index.html

Using the GNS32.0 remote server and the GSN32.0 gui.

1.) When using an already existing remote server setup in the gns.conf, images need to be updated to take new settings.
Solution: This can be fixed by removing and re-adding the images back to the gns3-gui or creating a new profile.
    
2.) Ethernet Switches when using local can not connect to remote server connections.
The error received is in reference to dynamips not being found, this appears to be a custom setting in our environment. I attempted to update the dynamips configuration on the gui, however, that appears to be local only and received the following message. `=> "/usr/local/bin/dynamips" does not exist`

3.) Dual local server and remote server causes issues with remote server reporting could not find dynamips on remote server for ethernet switches and transferring of images does not work.

Solution: create new profile for 'remote-only', allows for re-creation of images by re-importing. Seemed to have cleaned up the issue.

Update: We corrected the custom server image and now this works to spin-up the switches remote or local with no issues, still having problems with local --> remote connectivity, see point 6.

4.) Docker issue with the client running API 1.25 and the server running API 1.24.

![Docker Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heathdbrown/heathdbrown.github.io/master/img/GNS32.0-DockerError.png)

In this case the server is running an API of 1.24, found via `docker version`.

5.) Sharing Projects, when one person closes out the project all nodes are disabled.

6.) Dual local server and remote server issue when combining local and remote elements receive the following error.
`Error while creating link: No common subnet for compute local and CIN-Remote`
